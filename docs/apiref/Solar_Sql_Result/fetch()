<function>

access:   public

name: fetch

param: int, $mode, 2

return: array

</function>

Fetches one row from the result source.

* Parameters:

 * int //$mode//: A PDO::FETCH_* constant to specify how the row should be returned; default is PDO::FETCH_ASSOC.

* Returns array: An array of data from the fetched row.

Fetches one row from the result source.

If a row name has double-underscores, the result is placed into a
sub-array named for the part before the double-underscores.  For
example, if the row-name is "example__row_name", then you would
get back example['row_name'].

When combined with the automated deconfliction in
Solar_Sql_Select, this allows you to select from multiple tables
and segregate the columns from different tables automatically into
separate arrays.
