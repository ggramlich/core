access:   protected

name: _verify

return: bool

</function>

Verifies user credentials for the adapter.

* Parameters: none.

* Returns bool: True if valid, false if not.

Typical credentials are $this->_handle and $this->_passwd, but
single sign-on systems may use different credential sources.

Adapters should set $this->_handle, $this->_email, and
$this->_name if verfication is successful.
