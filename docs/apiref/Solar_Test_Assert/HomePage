* [Solar_Test_Assert::HomePage Solar_Test_Assert]

Class for simple unit-testing assertions.

If the assertion is successful, it returns boolean true with no
output.  If the assertion fails, it throws and prints an exception, 
then returns false.

This is effectively the same behavior as in Greg Beaver's 
PEAR_PHPTest class, but uses exceptions instead of PEAR_Error 
and debug_backtrace().
