 * Solar_Cache_File

File-based cache controller.

This is the file-based driver for [Solar_Cache:HomePage Solar_Cache].
In general, you never need to instantiate it yourself; instead,
use Solar_Cache as the frontend for it and specify
'Solar_Cache_File' as the 'driver' config key value.

If you specify a path (for storing cache entry files) that does
not exist, this driver attempts to create it for you.

This driver always uses [[php flock()]] when reading and writing
cache entries; it uses a shared lock for reading, and an exclusive
lock for writing.  This is to help cut down on cache corruption
when two processes are trying to access the same cache file entry,
one for reading and one for writing.

In addition, this driver automatically serializes and unserializes
arrays and objects that are stored in the cache.  This means you
can store not only string output, but also array data and entire
objects in the cache ... just like Solar_Cache_Memcache.
