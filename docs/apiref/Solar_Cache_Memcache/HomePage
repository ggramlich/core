Memcache cache controller.

This driver lets you connect to a [http://www.danga.com/memcached/
memcached] server, which uses system memory to cache data.  In
general, you never need to instantiate it yourself; instead, use
Solar_Cache as the frontend for it and specify
'Solar_Cache_Memcache' in the config keys as the 'driver' value.

This kind of cache is extremely fast, especially when on the same
server as the web process, although it may also be accessed via
network.  This particular driver uses the PHP [[php memcache]]
extension to manage the cache connection.  The extension is not
bundled with PHP; you will need to follow the
[http://php.net/memcache installation instructions] before you can
use it.
