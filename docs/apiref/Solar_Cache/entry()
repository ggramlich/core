param: string, $key

return: mixed

</function>

Returns the driver-specific name for the entry key.

* Parameters:

 * string //$key//: The entry ID.

* Returns mixed: The driver-specific name for the entry key.

Cache drivers do not always use the identifier you specify for
cache entries.  For example, the [Solar_Cache_File:HomePage file driver]
names the cache entries based on an MD5 hash of the entry ID. 
This method tells you what the driver is using as the name for
the cache entry.

<code type="php">
$cache = Solar::factory('Solar_Cache');

// create an entry ID named for the current URI
$id = Solar::server('REQUEST_URI');

// find out what the underlying cache driver uses as the entry name
$real_name = $cache->entry($id);
