++ Overview

Class for working with read-once flashes.

Taken from ideas popularized by Ruby on Rails, a "flash" is a session
value that propagates only until it is read, at which time it
is removed from the session.  This is useful for forwarding
information and messages between page loads without using get-vars
or cookies.
