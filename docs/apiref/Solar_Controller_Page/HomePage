 * Solar_Controller_Page

++ Overview

Abstract page-based application controller class for Solar.

Expects a directory structure like this example:

<code>
Example.php
Example/
  View/
    list.php
    item.php
    edit.php
  Locale/
    en_US.php
    pt_BR.php
</code>

Note that models are not included in the application itself; this is
for class-name deconfliction reasons.  Your models should be stored 
elsewhere in the Solar hierarchy, e.g. Example_Model_Name.
