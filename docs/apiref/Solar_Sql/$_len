protected array $_len

Max identifier lengths for table, column, and index names.

The total length cannot exceed 63 (the Postgres limit).

Reserve 3 chars for suffixes ("__i" for indexes, "__s" for
sequences).

Reserve 2 chars for table__index separator (again, because
Postgres needs unique names for indexes even on different tables).

This leaves 58 characters to split between table name and col/idx
name.  Figure tables need more "space", so they get 30 and
tables/indexes get 28.
