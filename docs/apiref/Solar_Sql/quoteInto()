</function>

Quotes a value and places into a piece of text at a placeholder.

* Parameters:

 * string //$txt//: The text with a placeholder.

 * mixed //$val//: The value to quote.

Quotes a value and places into a piece of text at a placeholder.

The placeholder is a question-mark; all placeholders will be replaced
with the quoted value.   For example:

<code type="php">
$sql = Solar::factory('Solar_Sql');

$text = "WHERE date < ?";
$date = "2005-01-02";
$safe = $sql->quoteInto($text, $date);

// $safe == "WHERE date < '2005-01-02'"
