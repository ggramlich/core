Class for connecting to SQL databases and performing common operations.

Example usage:

<code>
$config = array(
    'driver' => 'Solar_Sql_Driver_Mysql',
    'host' => '127.0.0.1',
    'user' => 'pmjones',
    'pass' => '********',
    'name' => 'test'

and delete operations on single tables.

selects.
