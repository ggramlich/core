</function>

Determines the diff (delete/insert matrix) between two tag sets.

* Parameters:

 * array //$old//: The old (previous) set of tags.

 * array //$new//: The new (current) set of tags.

* Returns array: An associative array of two keys: 'del' (where the value is a sequential array of tags removed from the old set) and 'ins' (where the value is a sequential array of tags to be added from the new set).

Determines the diff (delete/insert matrix) between two tag sets.

<code>
$old = array('a', 'b', 'c');
$new = array('c', 'd', 'e');

// perform the diff
$diff = $this->_diff($old, $new);

// the results are:
// $diff['del'] == array('a', 'b');
// $diff['ins'] == array('d', 'e');
// 'c' doesn't show up becuase it's present in both sets
