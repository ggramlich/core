</function>

Revalidates any current authentication and updates idle time.

* Parameters: none.

* Returns bool: Whether or not authentication is still valid.

Revalidates any current authentication and updates idle time.

Note that if your script runs more than 1 second, it is possible
that multiple calls to valid() may result in the authentication
expiring in the middle of the script.  As such, if you only need
to check that the user is logged in, look at the value of
$this->status.
