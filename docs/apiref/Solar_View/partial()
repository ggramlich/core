access:   public

param: string, $name

param: array, $vars, NULL

return: void

</function>

Executes a partial template in its own scope, optionally with 
variables into its within its scope.

* Parameters:

 * string //$name//: The partial template to process.

 * array //$vars//: Additional variables to extract within the  partial template scope.

* Returns void

Note that when you don't need scope separation, using a call to
"include $this->template($name)" is faster.
