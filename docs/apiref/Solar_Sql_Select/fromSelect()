param: array|string, $cols, '*'

return: Solar_Sql_Select

</function>

Adds a sub-select and columns to the query.

* Parameters:

 * string|Solar_Sql_Select //$spec//: If a Solar_Sql_Select object, use as the sub-select; if a string, the sub-select command string.

 * string //$name//: The alias name for the sub-select.

 * array|string //$cols//: The columns to retrieve from the  sub-select; by default, '*' (all columns).  This is unlike the normal from() and join() methods, which by default select no columns.

* Returns Solar_Sql_Select

The format is "FROM ($select) AS $name"; an alias name is
always required so we can deconflict columns properly.
