protected string $_action_info

The info variables to use for actions.

The format of this array is key-value pairs, where the key is
the action name, and the value is a slash-separated string of
$_info keys.  For example:

$_routes = array(
    'item' => 'id', // "item/:id"
    'list' => 'year/month', // "list/:year/:month"
);

You can then call $this->_info('id') for the 'item' action,
or $this->_info('year') and $this->_info('month') in the 'list'
action.
