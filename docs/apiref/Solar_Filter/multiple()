param: array, $filters

return: mixed

</function>

Applies multiple filters to a value.

* Parameters:

 * mixed //$value//: The value to be filtered.

 * array //$filters//: The filters to apply.

* Returns mixed: The filtered value.

Applies multiple filters to a value. $filters should be an array of
arrays, with each subarray consisting of at least one element. The first
element should be the filter type; this is the name of a valid
Solar_Filter method <b>OR</b> a PHP function. 

If the filter method is Solar_Filter::callback(), then the second argument should
be a valid callback. 

Any additional elements in the subarray will be passed as additional
arguments to the filter (the first argument to a filter function/method
is always the value being filtered).

Returns the transformed value after applying all filters.
