+ The Solar_Filter Class

Methods for filtering data.

An OOP container for applying filters to data, e.g., form elements.
Filters are typically callbacks that accept either a single value as
an argument (and return a transformed version of that value), or a
value to transform as the first argument and one or more additional
parameters.
