</function>

Convenience method to select rows from this table.

* Parameters:

 * string //$type//: The type of fetch to execute: 'all', 'one', 'row', etc. Default is 'result'.

 * array|string //$where//: An SQL WHERE clause to filter results.  May be an array:  If the key is a string, it's assumed to be a column name and the value is the equality comparison; the value is automatically bound into the query.  If the key is an integer, the value is a custom where clause.  Alternatively, $where may be a string, in which case it is a user-defined WHERE clause in its entirety (no binding).

 * array|string //$order//: An SQL ORDER clause, e.g. an array of column names.

 * int //$page//: The page-number of results to retrieve.

* Returns array
