public array $attribs

Attributes for the form tag itself.

The \\$attribs\\ array holds HTML attributes for the
form itself (not for individual elements) such as
\\action\\, \\method\\, and \\enctype\\.  Note that these
are "hints" for the presentation of the form, and may not
be honored by the view.
