public array $elements

The array of elements in this form.

The \\$elements\\ array contains all elements in the form,
including their names, types, values, any feedback messages,
validation and filter callbacks, and so on. 

In general, you should not try to set $elements yourself;
instead, Solar_Form::setElement() and Solar_Form::setElements().
