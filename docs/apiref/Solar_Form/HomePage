+ The Solar_Form Class

Class for hinting how to build forms.

This is technically a pseudo-form class.   It stores information for how
to build a form, but does not perform output.  Will validate data
in the form and generate feedback messages.

Built for use primarly with multiple Solar_Sql_Entity extended classes.
