public string|array $feedback

Overall feedback about the state of the form.

The \\$feedback\\ array stores feedback messages for
the form itself (not for individual elements). For example,
"Saved successfully." or "Please correct the noted errors."

If you like, you can set this to an array and add multiple
feedback messages.

Note that the $feedback property related the form itself,
and not to the individual elements.  Use this to convey
the state of the form as a whole to the end user; e.g.,
'Your input was saved', 'Please correct the information below',
'Comment held for moderation', and so on.
