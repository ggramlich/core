public array $feedback

Overall feedback about the state of the form.

The \\$feedback\\ array stores feedback messages for
the form itself (not for individual elements). For example,
"Saved successfully." or "Please correct the noted errors."
Each array element is an additional feedback message.

Note that the $feedback property pertains to the form as a
whole, not the individual elements.  This is as opposed to
the 'feedback' key in each of the elements, which contains
feedback specific to that element.
