</function>

Recursively pulls values from elements into an associative array.

* Parameters:

 * string //$key//: The current array key for the values array.  If this has square brackets in it, that's a sign we need to keep creating sub-elements for the values array.

 * mixed //$val//: The element value to put into the values array, once we stop creating sub-elements based on the element name.

 * array //$values//: The values array into which we will place the element value.  Note that it becomes a reference to sub-elements as the recursive function creates new sub-elements based on the form element name.

* Returns void
