 * Solar_User_Auth_Htpasswd

++ Overview

Authenticate against a file generated by htpasswd.

Format for each line is "username:hashedpassword\n";

Automatically checks against DES, SHA, and apr1-MD5.

SECURITY NOTE: Default DES encryption will only check up to the first
8 characters of a password; chars after 8 are ignored.  This means
that if the real password is "atechars", the word "atecharsnine" would
be valid.  This is bad.  As a workaround, if the password provided by
the user is longer than 8 characters, and DES encryption is being
used, this class will *not* validate it.
