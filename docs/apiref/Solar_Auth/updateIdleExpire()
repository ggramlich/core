<function>

access:   public

name: updateIdleExpire

return: bool

</function>

Updates idle and expire times, invalidating authentication if
they are exceeded.

* Parameters: none.

* Returns bool: Whether or not authentication is still valid.

Note that if your script runs more than 1 second, it is possible
that multiple calls to this method may result in the authentication
expiring in the middle of the script.  As such, if you only need
to check that the user is logged in, call $this->isValid().
