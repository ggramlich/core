//Inherited from Solar_Controller_Page::_forward().//

<function>

access:   protected

name: _forward

param: string, $action

param: array, $params, NULL

return: void

</function>

Forwards internally to another action, using pre- and post-
action hooks, and resets $this->_view to the requested action.

* Parameters:

 * string //$action//: The action name.

 * array //$params//: Parameters to pass to the action method.

* Returns void

You should generally use "return $this->_forward(...)" instead
of just $this->_forward; otherwise, script execution will come
back to where you called the forwarding.
