* [Solar_Base::HomePage Solar_Base]

Abstract base class for all Solar objects.

This is the class from which almost all other Solar classes are
extended.  Solar_Base is relatively light, and provides:

* Construction-time reading of [Main:ConfigFile config file] options 
  for itself, and merging of those options with any options passed   
  for instantation, along with the class-defined $_config defaults,  
  into the Solar_Base::$_config property.                            
                                                                    
* A Solar_Base::locale() convenience method to return class-specific
  locale strings.  This method...

 # Automatically loads the translated strings from the correct file,

 # Automatically re-loads them if the locale code changes,

 # Automatically falls back to the "generic" Solar-wide translations
   if a class-specific translation key does not exist.

* A Solar_Base::_exception() convenience method to generate
  exception objects with translated strings from the locale file
