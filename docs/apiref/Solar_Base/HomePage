+ The Solar_Base Class

Abstract base class for all Solar objects.

This is the class from which almost all other Solar classes are
extended.  Solar_Base is relatively light, and provides:

* Construction-time reading of [Main:ConfigFile config file] options 
  for itself, and merging of those options with any options passed   
  for instantation, along with the class-defined config defaults,  
  into the Solar_Base::$_config property.

* A Solar_Base::locale() convenience method to return locale strings.

* A Solar_Base::_exception() convenience method to generate
  exception objects with translated strings from the locale file

Note that you do not define config defaults in $_config directly; 
instead, you use a protected property named for the class, with an
underscore prefix.  For exmple, a "Vendor_Class_Name" class would 
define the default config array in "$_Vendor_Class_Name".  This 
convention lets child classes inherit parent config keys and values.
