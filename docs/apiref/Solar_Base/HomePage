+ The Solar_Base Class

Abstract base class for all Solar objects.

This is the class from which almost all other Solar classes are
extended.  Solar_Base is relatively light, and provides:

* Construction-time reading of [Main:ConfigFile config file] options 
  for itself, and merging of those options with any options passed   
  for instantation, along with the class-defined $_config defaults,  
  into the Solar_Base::$_config property.

* A Solar_Base::locale() convenience method to return locale strings.

* A Solar_Base::_exception() convenience method to generate
  exception objects with translated strings from the locale file
