To convert your old bookmarks to the new system:

0. MAKE A BACKUP of your current database.

1. Upgrade to Solar 0.9.0, but do not browse to your bookmarks yet.

2. Instead, put the migrate/0.8.0-0.9.0/scripts/bookmarks.php file somewhere in your web root and browse to that.  This will examine the old 'sc_bookmarks' table and convert to the new generic content tables ('areas', 'nodes', etc).

3. That's it.  :-)
