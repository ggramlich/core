The $_config property has a special purpose within Solar classes: it contains the configuration parameters for instantiating an object.  When you extend Solar_Base and instantiate the subclassed object, any key in this array will be re-populated with related keys from the [Main::ConfigFile config file], and/or from keys set in the configuration parameter of Solar::factory() at instantiation time.

Within $_config, the 'locale' key itself has a special purpose; the Solar_Base::locale() method uses it to determine where localization files related to the class are stored.  Thus, if you have a 'locale' key in your $_config array, it should always be a string that tells where the [Main::LocaleFiles locale files] are.

Because Solar_Base is intended for extension, you can add as many config keys as you like.  But remember, the \\locale\\ key is reserved because has a special meaning for Solar_Base classes, as it is used for Solar_Base::locale() automatic translation services.
