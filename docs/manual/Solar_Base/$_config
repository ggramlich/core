The $_config property has a special purpose within Solar classes: it
contains the configuration parameters for instantiating an object.

When you extend Solar_Base and instantiate the subclassed object, any
key in this array will be re-populated with related keys from the
[[Main::ConfigFile | config file]], and/or from keys set in the
configuration parameter of [[Solar::factory()]] at instantiation time.

Because Solar_Base is intended for extension, you can add as many config
keys as you like.
