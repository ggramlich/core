(This method is part of a [http://www.phppatterns.com/docs/design/the_registry registry pattern].  Basically, it allows you to share the same object throughout your application without using globals.)

Once an object has been registered using Solar::register(), this method gets an object from the registry using its unique name.

You can then use Solar::registry() elsewhere in your application to access that same object.

<code type="php">
$example = Solar::registry('example');
