This method accesses the $_SESSION superglobal array and
returns a copy of the requested key.  If no key is
specified, a copy of the entire $_SESSION array is
returned.  If the requested key does not exist in the
$_SESSION array, the default value is returned instead.

For example, to get the 'last_active' key from the $_SESSION
array, with \\false\\ as the default value, you would do this:

<code type="php">
$last_active = Solar::session('last_active', false);
</code>
