Stops the Solar environment.  As a counterpart to
[[Solar::start()]], the stop() method shuts down the Solar
environment.

{{code: php
    require_once 'Solar.php';
    Solar::start();

    // the rest of the script goes here

    Solar::stop();
}}

Effectively, all this does it execute any scripts named in
[[Solar::$config]]['Solar']['stop'].  This allows you to run
shutdown scripts particular to your system.
