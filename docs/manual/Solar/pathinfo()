This method is a bit different from the other superglobal
methods.  It accesses the $_SERVER['PATH_INFO'] value, and
returns copy of the requested key.  If no key is
specified, the entire path-info set is returned as an array.

The "path-info" portion of a URI comes after the script name
but before any $_GET parameters.  For example, in the
following URI ...

<code>
http://example.com/path/to/script.php/foo/bar/baz?zim=gir
</code>

... the "path-info" is `/foo/bar/baz`.

Path-info values are addressed by their integer position
number, not by associative array key name (as with $_GET et.
al.).  Thus, Solar builds its path-info array for the example
URI to look like this:

<code type="php">
array(
  0 => 'foo',
  1 => 'bar',
  2 => 'baz',
);
</code>

For example, to get path-info values, you would call the
pathinfo() method like this:

<code type="php">
$info_2 = Solar::pathinfo(2, null);  // equals 'baz'
$info_3 = Solar::pathinfo(3, 'dib'); // equals 'dib'
</code>
