This method accesses the $_COOKIE superglobal array and
returns a copy of the requested key.  If no key is
specified, a copy of the entire $_COOKIE array is
returned.  If the requested key does not exist in the $_COOKIE
array, the default value is returned instead.

For example, to get the 'remember_me' key from the $_COOKIE
array, with `false` as the default value, you would do this:

<code type="php">
$remember_me = Solar::cookie('remember_me', false);
</code>
