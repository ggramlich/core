This method accesses the $_POST superglobal array and returns
a copy of the requested key.  If no key is
specified, a copy of the entire $_POST array is
returned.  If the requested key does not exist in the $_POST
array, the default value is returned instead.

For example, to get the 'subject_line' key from the $_POST
array, with 'No Subject' as the default value, you would do
this:

<code type="php">
$subject = Solar::post('subject_line', 'No Subject');
</code>
