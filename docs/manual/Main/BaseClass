====================
Base Class
====================

The [[Solar_Base::HomePage | Solar_Base]] class is a lightweight base
class from which all other Solar classes descend (not including
exceptions, which descend from the [[Solar_Exception::HomePage |
Solar_Exception]] class). This base class provides:

* A standard constructor that reads from the [[ConfigFile]] then
  combines the instantiation-time [[ConstructorParameters]] with the
  default property values for the class. C.f.
  [[Solar_Base::__construct()]].

* A single property to collect configuration values for the class and
  its parents. C.f. [[Solar_Base::$_config]].

* A method for finding and returning exceptions with localized message
  text. C.f. [[Solar_Base::_exception()]].

* A method for finding and returning localized text strings. C.f.
  [[Solar_Base::locale()]].

* A method for finding the API version of the class. C.f.
  [[Solar_Base::apiVersion()]].
