+ Naming Conventions

++ Class Names

All Solar class names start with \\Solar_\\ and map directly to their filesystem location, where the underscore represents a new directory.  For example, the \\Solar_User_Auth_Sql\\ class is located at \\Solar/User/Auth/Sql.php\\.  This makes it possible to use \\Solar::loadClass()\\ and \\Solar::factory()\\ to automatically load and configure new instances.

++ Method Names

When reasonable, methods in Solar classes should conform to these names when they perform these related functions:

||~ Method Name ||~ Usage ||~ Examples ||
|| get        || gets the value of a property || $obj->getProperty() ||
|| set        || sets the value of a property || $obj->setProperty($value) ||
|| fetch      || fetches one entry from storage (instead of get/find/retrieve) || $cache->fetch($id) ||
|| fetchAll   || fetches multiple entries from storage || $table->fetchAll() ||
|| fetchBy    || fetches one entry from storage, using alternative criteria (instead of fetchWith/fetchFor) || $table->fetchByName($name) ||
|| fetchAllBy || fetches mulitple entries from storage, using alternative criteria (instead of fetchWith/fetchFor) || $table->fetchAllByName($name) ||
|| insert     || inserts new data in storage (instead of add/new/save) || $table->insert($data) ||
|| update     || updates existing data in storage (instead of save/change) || $table->update($data, $where), $file->update($data, $path) ||
|| save       || updates existing data **or** inserts new data in storage (instead of replace) || $cache->save($id, $data) ||
|| delete     || deletes data from storage (instead of remove) || $table->delete($where), $cache->delete($id) ||

These names are set in stone, but should be used whenever reasonable.

++ Global Variables

Do not use global variables.  We say this for two reasons:

# They open up security problems when \\register_globals\\ is turned on

# They pollute the global namespace and may collide or overwrite each other in differing contexts

++ Session Variables

\\$_SESSION\\ keys for Solar classes shall match the class name.  Thus, a \\Solar_Example_Class\\ session variable called \\something\\ would be addressed as \\$_SESSION['Solar_Example_Class']['something']\\.

++ Config File Keys

Keys in the ConfigFile shall conform to the class name.  Thus, a \\Solar_Example_Class\\ constructor configuration would be addressed as an associative array in the \\['Solar_Example_Class']\\ key of the ConfigFile.

++ Locale File Names

LocaleFiles should be named for their locale code.  For example, the \\en_US\\  file should be named \\en_US.php\\, the \\pt_BR\\ file should be named \\pt_BR.php\\, and so on.

++ Locale Translation Keys

Keys in the LocaleFiles should be in all capitals, using only A-Z, 0-9, and underscores for the key name.  In general, you should prefix the key name with a hint for its usage:

||~ Prefix     ||~ Usage ||
|| \\DESCR_\\  || Form element descriptions (long) ||
|| \\ERR_\\    || Error and exceptions messages ||
|| \\FORMAT_\\ || Strings related to formatting for the locale ||
|| \\LABEL_\\  || Form element labels (short) ||
|| \\OK_\\     || Success messages ||
|| \\SUBMIT_\\ || Controller action operations (typically submit-button values) ||
|| \\TEXT_\\   || General-purpose text ||
|| \\WARN_\\   || Warning or failure messages ||
