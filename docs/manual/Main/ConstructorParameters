+ Constructor Parameters

All \\__construct()\\ methods in Solar have exactly one parameter:  an associative array.  That array is then populated into the protected \\$_config\\ property used in all classes descended from the Solar BaseClass.

Most classes in the PHP world use a sequential set of parameters for constructors; e.g., if you wanted to specify three pieces of information for a constructor, you would do something like this:

<code type="php">
class Normal_Example {
    public $a = null;
    public $b = null;
    public $c = null;
    public function __construct($a, $b, $c)
    {
        $this->a = $a;
        $this->b = $b;
        $this->c = $c;
    }
}

$example = new Normal_Example('one', 'two', 'three')
</code>

In comparison, Solar classes are instantiated like this:

<code type="php">
class Solar_Example extends Solar_Base {
    protected $_config = array(
        'a' => null,
        'b' => null,
        'c' => null,
    );
}

$config = array('a' => 'one', 'b' => 'two', 'c' => 'three');
$example = new Solar_Example($config);
</code>

Why do things this way?  The idea is to make it easy to read data from a ConfigFile and automatically configure object instances.  In the Solar_Example class, the constructor parameter could easily be read from a configuration file and passed to the Solar_Example constructor, which is not so easy with the Normal_Example.

**Note:** Usually Solar objects are instantiated via Solar::factory(), not via direct instantiation as above, but you get the idea.
