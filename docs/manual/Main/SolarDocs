====================
Documentation
====================

Documentation is as important as the code itself.  With that in mind, we have combined two forms of documentation on this site:

* All classes have basic API reference material automatically generated
  with each new release.

* In addition, we also maintain manual narratives (overview, how-to,
  tutorial, getting started, etc) as part of the class documentation.

Click on the pull-down at the top-right of this page (it's labeled "Main" right now) and select the class you want to read about.  For example, read about the overarching Solar class itself [Solar::HomePage here].

If you want to help with editing documentation pages directly, please join the MailingList and make a request there.  (And thanks!)
