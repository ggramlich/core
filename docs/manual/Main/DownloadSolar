====================
Download and Install
====================

--------------------
Requirements
--------------------

* Please note that Solar is in alpha stage and is not yet stable.

* Solar is written to E_STRICT standards for PHP5, and will not work under PHP4.

* Solar is completely self-contained and has no external dependencies.  When you install Solar, you get everything at once: all the libraries, models, and applications that compose Solar.  This helps to avoid "dependency hell" when upgrading your installation.

* Solar comes with support for the following database backends; while not required, you will probably want one of them installed:

 * Microsoft SQL Server 2000 or later

 * MySQL 4.1 or later

 * PostgreSQL 7.3 or later

 * SQLite 3 or later


--------------------
Direct Download
--------------------

You can download Solar directly from this link:

<http://solarphp.com/get/Solar-@package_version@.tgz>

Then copy the `Solar.php` file and `Solar/` directory into your libraries.

However, it's usually better to use the PEAR installer.


--------------------
Install via PEAR
--------------------

You can use our [channel server](http://solarphp.com/channel.php) to install and upgrade.  Using the channel is the preferred method, because it will always install the most-recent version.

First, let PEAR discover the channel server...

{{code: bash
    bash-2.05$ pear channel-discover solarphp.com
    Adding Channel "solarphp.com" succeeded
    Discovery of channel "solarphp.com" succeeded
    bash-2.05$ 
}}

... then you can install or upgrade:

{{code: bash
    bash-2.05$ pear install Solar/Solar-alpha
    ... installation messages follow ...

    bash-2.05$ pear upgrade Solar/Solar-alpha
    ... upgrade messages follow ...
}}

Because Solar is still in alpha, you need to specify the "-alpha" flag when installing or upgrading.


Bundled Documentation
====================

When PEAR installs the Solar classes, it will place the bundled documentation in a different location.  Typically, you will find the classes in `/path/to/pear/`, while documentation will be in `/path/to/pear/docs/Solar/`.


Bundled Tests
====================

When PEAR installs the Solar classes, it will place the bundled test files in a different location.  Typically, you will find the classes in `/path/to/pear/`, while the test files will be in `/path/to/pear/tests/Solar/`.


Problems?
====================

If you have problems with the channel not delivering the most-recent release, clear your local PEAR cache and try again:

{{code: bash
    bash-2.05$ pear clear-cache
    reading directory
    cache entries cleared

    bash-2.05$ pear upgrade Solar/Solar-alpha
    ... upgrade messages follow ...
}}

Alternatively, you can use PEAR to install or upgrade a specific release directly from a tarball, like this:

{{code: bash
    bash-2.05$ pear install http://solarphp.com/get/Solar-@package_version@.tgz
    ... installation messages follow ...

    bash-2.05$ pear upgrade http://solarphp.com/get/Solar-@package_version@.tgz
    ... upgrade messages follow ...
}}

--------------------
Source via Subversion
--------------------

You can [browse the Subversion repository](http://solarphp.com/svn/) and do anonymous checkouts:

{{code: bash
    bash-2.05$ svn checkout https://solarphp.com/svn/trunk/ solar
}}
