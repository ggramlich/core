+ Download and Install

++ Requirements

* Please note that Solar is in development and is not yet stable.

* Solar is written to E_STRICT standards for PHP5, and will not work under PHP4.

* Solar is completely self-contained and has no external dependencies.  When you install Solar, you get everything at once: all the libraries, models, and applications that compose Solar.  This helps to avoid "dependency hell" when upgrading your installation.

* Solar comes with support for the following database backends; while not required, you will probably want one of them installed:

 * !FrontBase

 * Microsoft SQL

 * !MySQL

 * !PostgreSQL

 * SQLite

++ Direct Download

You can download Solar directly from this link:

http://solarphp.com/get/Solar-0.16.1.tgz

Then copy the \\Solar.php\\ file and \\Solar/\\ directory into your libraries.

However, it's usually better to use the PEAR installer.


++ Install via PEAR

You can use our [http://solarphp.com/channel.php channel server] to install and upgrade.  Using the channel is the preferred method, because it will always install the most-recent version.

First, let PEAR discover the channel server...

<code>
bash-2.05$ pear channel-discover solarphp.com
Adding Channel "solarphp.com" succeeded
Discovery of channel "solarphp.com" succeeded
bash-2.05$ 
</code>

... then you can install or upgrade:

<code>
bash-2.05$ pear install Solar/Solar-alpha
... installation messages follow ...

bash-2.05$ pear upgrade Solar/Solar-alpha
... upgrade messages follow ...
</code>

Because Solar is still in alpha, you need to specify the "-alpha" flag when installing or upgrading.


+++ Bundled Documentation

When PEAR installs the Solar classes, it will place the bundled documentation in a different location.  Typically, you will find the classes in \\/path/to/pear/\\, while documentation will be in \\/path/to/pear/docs/Solar/\\.


+++ Bundled Tests

When PEAR installs the Solar classes, it will place the bundled test files in a different location.  Typically, you will find the classes in \\/path/to/pear/\\, while the test files will be in \\/path/to/pear/tests/Solar/\\.


+++ Problems?

If you have problems with the channel not delivering the most-recent release, clear your local PEAR cache and try again:

<code>
bash-2.05$ pear clear-cache
reading directory
cache entries cleared

bash-2.05$ pear upgrade Solar/Solar-alpha
... upgrade messages follow ...
</code>

Alternatively, you can use PEAR to install or upgrade a specific release directly from a tarball, like this:

<code>
bash-2.05$ pear install http://solarphp.com/get/Solar-0.16.1.tgz
... installation messages follow ...

bash-2.05$ pear upgrade http://solarphp.com/get/Solar-0.16.1.tgz
... upgrade messages follow ...
</code>

++ Source via Subversion

You can [http://solarphp.com/svn/ browse the Subversion repository] and do anonymous checkouts:

<code>
bash-2.05$ svn checkout https://solarphp.com/svn/ solar
</code>
