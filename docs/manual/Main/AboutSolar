+ About Solar

[HomePage Solar] is a **S**imple **O**bject **L**ibrary and **A**pplication **R**epository for PHP5.

It is the brainchild of [http://paul-m-jones.com/ Paul M. Jones] who winkingly calls himself the "Benevolent Dictator" of the Solar system.  Other developers are working on additional components for the standard project distribution package, all licensed under the LGPL.

Solar uses concepts derived from the [http://phpsavant.com/ Savant] template system, the [http://pear.php.net/DB_Table DB_Table] object-relation management package, and the [http://phpyawp.com/ Yawp] foundation for PHP applications.


++ Similar Projects

Solar is similar to these other PHP projects, but has its own specific [SolarGoals goals] and [SolarDocs standards].

* [http://pear.php.net/ PEAR]

 * The Solar project is similar to PEAR in that it provides a class library of useful components for PHP development that adhere to a common standard of development.  However, with the exception of the base PEAR classes themselves (e.g. PEAR_Error), classes in PEAR are not intended to be a cohesive framework.

* [http://horde.org/ Horde]

 * Solar is also similar to Horde in that it attempts to provide a cohesive framework for application development.  Horde has a long and distinguished history, but is based on PHP4; while this does not prevent Horde from being used in a PHP5 environment, it is not E_STRICT compliant.

* [http://framework.zend.com/ Zend Framework]

 * Solar and ZF look very similar at first glance; however, Solar pre-dates the Zend Framework by about a year.  You can read more about the differences [http://lists.solarphp.com/pipermail/solar-talk/2006-March/000636.html here].
