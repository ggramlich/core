[HomePage Solar] is a **S**imple **O**bject **L**ibrary and **A**pplication **R**epository for PHP5.

It is the brainchild of [http://paul-m-jones.com/ Paul M. Jones] who winkingly calls himself the "Benevolent Dictator" of the Solar system.  Other developers are working on additional components for the standard project distribution package, all licensed under the LGPL.

Solar uses concepts derived from the [http://phpsavant.com/ Savant] template system, the [http://pear.php.net/DB_Table DB_Table] object-relation management package, and the [http://phpyawp.com/ Yawp] foundation for PHP applications.

While similar to both [http://pear.php.net/ PEAR] and [http://horde.org/ Horde], Solar has its own specific [SolarGoals goals] and [SolarDocs standards].


++ Similar to PEAR

The Solar project is similar in goals to [http://pear.php.net/ PEAR] in that it provides a class library of useful components for PHP development that adhere to a common standard of development.  However, with the exception of the initial PEAR classes themselves (e.g. PEAR_Error), classes in PEAR are not intended to be a cohesive framework.

++ Similar to Horde

Solar is also similar in goals to [http://horde.org/ Horde] in that attempts to provide a cohesive framework for application development.  Horde has a long and distinguished history, but is based on PHP4; while this does not prevent Horde from being used in a PHP5 environment, it is not E_STRICT compliant.
