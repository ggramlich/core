This class helps you to create and manipulate URIs, including query strings and path-info elements.  It does so by splitting up the pieces of the URI and allowing you modify them individually; you can then then export the components as a single URI string.  This helps when building complex links, such as in a paged navigation system.

The following is a simple example.  Say that the page address is currently \\``http://anonymous::guest@example.com/path/to/index.php/foo/bar?baz=dib#anchor``\\ (note the path-info string after the index.php script name).  You can use Solar_Uri to parse this complex string very easily:

<code type="php">
require_once 'Solar.php';
Solar::start();

// create a URI object; this will automatically import the current
// location, which is...
// 
// http://anonymous::guest@example.com/path/to/index.php/foo/bar?baz=dib#anchor
$uri = Solar::factory('Solar_Uri');

// now the $uri properties are:
// 
// $uri->scheme   => 'http'
// $uri->host     => 'example.com'
// $uri->user     => 'anonymous'
// $uri->pass     => 'guest'
// $uri->path     => '/path/to/index.php'
// $uri->info     => array('foo', 'bar')
// $uri->query    => array('baz' => 'dib')
// $uri->fragment => 'anchor'
</code>

Now that we have imported the URI and had it parsed automatically, we can modify the component parts, then export a new URI string.

<code type="php">
// change to 'https://'
$uri->scheme = 'https';

// remove the username and password
$uri->user = '';
$uri->pass = '';

// change the value of 'baz' to 'zab'
$uri->setQuery('baz', 'zab');

// add a new query element called 'zim' with a value of 'gir'
$uri->addQuery('zim', 'gir');

// reset the pathinfo to something else entirely
$uri->setInfoString('/something/else');

// and export it to a string.
$new_uri = $uri->export();

// the $new_uri string is:
// https://example.com/path/to/index.php/something/else?baz=zab&zim=gir#anchor
</code>

As you can see, this class is quite powerful when it comes to URIs.  For more information, be sure to read about the various PublicMethods.
