This is the most-direct way to interact with the database; you simply pass an SQL statement to the method, and the underlying [Solar_Sql_Adapter::HomePage Solar_Sql_Adapter] class uses [[php PDO]] to execute the statement and return a result.

{{code: php
    $sql = Solar::factory('Solar_Sql');

    // $result is a PDOStatement
    $result = $sql->query('SELECT * FROM table');

    // $result is a row-count
    $value = $sql->quote('something');
    $result = $sql->query("UPDATE table SET col = $value");
}}

To helper prevent SQL injection attacks, you should **always** quote the values used in a direct query.  Use Solar_Sql::quote(), Solar_Sql::quoteInto(), or Solar_Sql::quoteMulti() to accomplish this.

Note that Solar_Sql provides convenience methods to automatically quote values on common operations:

* Solar_Sql::insert()

* Solar_Sql::update()

* Solar_Sql::delete()

Additionally, the [Solar_Sql_Select::HomePage Solar_Sql_Select] class is dedicated to safely creating portable SELECT statements, so you may wish to use that as well.
