// ugh:
$bookmarks = Solar::factory('Solar_Content_Bookmarks');

Add dates to content model (e.g., begin and end dates)

Rename "rank" to "position"

ALSO NEED ACCESS CONTROL!

----

COMPONENT TASKS

delete an area (and all nodes, edits, etc)

add a node revision

delete a node (and all edits, etc)

edits themselves should be below notice at this level

----

Solar_Content_Comments

Need a 'remember me' function?

Need to separate Solar_Model_Comments_Rules into a standalone
content-filtering class ... or add a file-based plugin mechanism? 
or both?  Text_Bayes?  Text_Filter?

Standalone comment system tasks

    select comments for an area and node (paged)
    insert a new comment on a area/node
        essentially a new node of type 'comment' as part_of the collection master node
    update a comment in-place (not a revision)
    delete a comment
    tag a comment as spam, or for moderation


----

Forum system

Each node is a separate thread
Parts:
    'forum' (the collection master node)
    'comments' on that entry
    

----

Issue Tracking System

    a standard issues table
    use the universal comment system driven by the content system
    what area and node do we use in these cases?
    area_name: Solar_App_Issues
    node_name: 12345
    connect first to the bugs table, then grab comments from general content
