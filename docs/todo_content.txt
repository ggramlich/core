Add dates to content model (e.g., begin and end dates)

ALSO NEED ACCESS CONTROL!

COMPONENT TASKS

delete an area (and all nodes, edits, etc)

add a node revision

delete a node (and all edits, etc)

edits themselves should be below notice at this level

----

Standalone comment system tasks

select comments for an area and node (paged)
insert a new comment on a area/node
    essentially a new node of type 'comment' as part_of the collection master node
update a comment in-place (not a revision)
delete a comment
tag a comment as spam, or for moderation

Forum system

Each node is a separate thread
Parts:
    'forum' (the collection master node)
    'comments' on that entry
    

----

Issue Tracking System

    a standard issues table
    use the universal comment system driven by the content system
    what area and node do we use in these cases?
    area_name: Solar_App_Issues

    connect first to the bugs table, then grab comments from general content
