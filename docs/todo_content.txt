GENERIC CONTENT MODEL

Still need:

Solar/
	Content.php
	Content/
		Pings.php
		Hits.php
		Words.php
		

----

When you fetch a node, you need to get the most-recent edits of each of the parts.	

And you need to be able to say which part types you want to get.

	SELECT parts.*, edits.*
	FROM parts
	JOIN edits ON parts.part_edit_id = edits.edit_id
	WHERE
		parts.part_area_name = :area_name AND
		parts.part_node_name = :node_name AND
		parts.part_type IN (:part_type)

----

COMBINED TASKS

new part by area and node (auto-adds the area, node, and edit)
update part by area, node, and id (updates the edit)
replace part by area, node, and id (inserts new edit)

----

COMPONENT TASKS

insert a new area
update an area
delete an area (and all nodes, parts, edits, etc)

insert a new node (with no parts)
update a node (including tags)
delete a node (and all parts, edits, etc)

insert a new part for a node (and its first edit)
update a part (and its most-recent edit, in-place)
revise a part as a new edit (which adds a new edit)
delete a part (and all its edits)

edits themselves should be below notice at this level

----

Standalone comment system tasks

select comments for an area and node (paged)
insert a new comment on a area/node
	essentially a new part of type 'comment'
update a comment in-place (not a revision)
delete a comment
flag a comment as spam, or for moderation


----

Forum system

Each node is a separate thread
Parts:
	'forum' (the initial entry)
	'comments' on that entry
	

----

Issue Tracking System

	a standard issues table
	use the universal comment system driven by the content system
	what area and node do we use in these cases?
	area_name: Solar_App_Issues
	node_name: 12345
	connect first to the bugs table, then grab comments from general content

----

Bookmark System fits entirely within content system

	area_name -- pmjones_bookmarks
	node_name -- wiki-fied URI title
	part_type -- bookmark
	edit_mime -- text/plain
	edit_subj -- URI for the link URI
	edit_summ -- title for the link
	edit_body -- description of the link

Selecting bookmarks:

SELECT *
FROM edits
WHERE
	areas.area_name == 'pmjones_bookmarks' AND
	parts.part_type == 'bookmark' AND
	parts.user_handle == 'pmjones' AND
	
...???...
