GENERIC CONTENT MODEL

Convert from Solar_Content to Solar_Model_Content:

Solar/
    Model/
        Content/
            Areas.php -- broad content areas (logical namespaces)
            Nodes.php -- nodes of content in the namespaces
            Tags.php -- searchable tags on a node

Need to add Solar_Model_Content_Hits for hits and visitors

Content types:
    comment (comments received)
    ping (pings sent)
    trackback (trackbacks received)
    pingback (pingbacks received)
    todo (to-do lists)
    blog (blog entry)
    wiki (wiki page)
    file (generic file attachments)
    forum (discussion thread)
    gallery (image gallery)

Have a Solar_Model_ContentType class for retrieving specific types?
    Solar_Content_Bookmarks extends Solar_Model_ContentType
    
ALSO NEED ACCESS CONTROL!

Each node is a separate thread
Parts:

Issue Tracking System

    a standard issues table
    use the universal comment system driven by the content system
