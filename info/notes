Overview
--------

* Optimized queries for countPages() and the native-by select strategy.

* Added automatic cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protections at various
  levels of the system.

* Optimized session-starting strategies.

* Added named-action support in the rewrite logic; this is the
  "bi-directional" routing that some have asked for.


New Classes
-----------

* Solar_Csrf: Collection point for CSRF functionality.

* Solar_Uri_Rewrite: Extracted rewrite logic from Solar_Controller_Front and
  placed into this new class. Support the previous "pattern => rewrite" keys,
  and support named actions with their own pattern, rewrite, replace, and
  default values.

* Solar_View_Helper_NamedAction: Generates an anchor based on a named action
  in the rewrite rules.

* Solar_View_Helper_NamedActionHref: Generates an HREF string based on a named
  action in the rewrite rules.

* Solar_View_Helper_NamedActionUri: Generates a Solar_Uri_Action object based
  on a named action in the rewrite rules.


Solar
-----

* [CHG] In method start(), auto-register a Solar_Uri_Rewrite object under
  the name 'rewrite'.


Solar_Auth_Adapter
------------------

* [CHG] Method isLoginRequest() does not honor CSRF attempts.

* [CHG] Method isLogoutRequest() does not honor CSRF attempts.


Solar_Cli_MakeModel
-------------------

* [FIX] In metadata.php skeleton, retain indexes in $_index_info, not $_index.


Solar_Cli_(MakeVendor|LinkVendor|UnlinkVendor)
----------------------------------------------

* [ADD] Add support for a Fixture directory in vendor sources.


Solar_Class_Stack
-----------------

* [FIX] Use 'class' as the error info key, not 'name', so that message data is
  interpolated properly.


Solar_Controller_Front
----------------------

* [CHG] Property $_rewrite is now the registered Solar_Uri_Rewrite object,
  not an array of rewrite rules.

* [DEL] Property $_replace, since it now exists in Solar_Uri_Rewrite.

* [CHG] Method _postConstruct() now merges config keys 'rewrite' and 'replace'
  into the registered rewrite object instead of retaining them locally.

* [CHG] Method _rewrite() uses the registered rewrite object now that the
  logic from this method has been moved there.


Solar_Controller_Page
---------------------

* [CHG] Method fetch() will not forward to the first action on a CSRF attempt;
  instead, invokes added _csrfAttempt() method.

* [ADD] Method _csrfAttempt() to display output when a CSRF attack is
  detected.

* [ADD] Property $_rewrite is the registered Solar_Uri_Rewrite object.


Solar_Form
----------

* [ADD] Property $_csrf as a Solar_Csrf object.

* [CHG] Method validate() invalidates the form as a whole on a CSRF attempt.

* [CHG] Method reset() adds a CSRF element when a CSRF token exists.


Solar_Http_Request_Adapter_Stream
---------------------------------

* [FIX] Now works when PHP is compiled --with-curlwrappers; thanks, kalkin,
  for the fix.


Solar_Session
-------------

* [REF] Refactor method _postConstruct() to extract new method lazyStart().

* [CHG] Method delete() now lazy-starts the session; this keeps it from
  starting a new session even if the value does not exist to be deleted.

* [CHG] Method reset() now lazy-starts the session; this keeps it from
  starting a new session even if there is nothing to be reset.

* [CHG] Method deleteFlash() now lazy-starts the session; this keeps it from
  starting a new session even if the value does not exist to be deleted.

* [CHG] Method resetFlash() now lazy-starts the session; this keeps it from
  starting a new session even if there is nothing to be reset.

* [CHG] Method resetAll() no longer starts a session on its own.


Solar_Sql_Model
---------------

* [CHG] Method countPages() no longer uses the exact same params as the
  original fetch. Instead, it clones the fetch object for native keeps.

* [FIX] Method _fixModelName() no longer uses the table name directly for the
  default model name. This is because it may be an 'alternative' table.
  Instead, uses the suffix after the Model_* in the class name.


Solar_Sql_Model_Params_Fetch
----------------------------

* [CHG] Method join() now accepts a 'keep' join descriptor key: `true` means
  we should keep the join for native selects; `false` means we should not;
  `null` (the default) means keep it only if it is not a left join.

* [ADD] Method cloneForKeeps() to clone the fetch params for a countPages()
  call in the model, and for native-by selects from relateds. This clears all
  `eager` params so they don't get rebuilt by Model::newSelect(), and keeps
  only joins that are marked for keeping (i.e., because they select only on
  the native model).


Solar_Sql_Model_Related
-----------------------

* [CHG] In method _getNativeBySelect(), we no longer clone the $fetch params
  internally. Instead, use $fetch->cloneForKeeps() to get a clone with only
  the necessary joins.


Solar_Sql_Model_Related_HasManyThrough
--------------------------------------

* [ADD] New relationship option 'through_join_type' to determine the
  join type for the through table; default is 'left'.

* [CHG] In method _modEagerFetch(), always force the through and foreign join
  types to lower-case.

* [CHG] In method _modEagerFetch(), set 'keep' explicitly on both the through
  join and on the foreign join.  The through join is normal (i.e., keep it
  it is non-left), and the foreign join is kept only if we kept the through
  join *and* the foreign join is non-left.


Solar_Request
-------------

* [ADD] Property $_csrf as a Solar_Csrf object.

* [ADD] Method isCsrf() to see if the request looks like a cross-site request
  forgery.


Solar_View_Helper_Action_Uri
----------------------------

* [CHG] Method actionUri() now takes an optional parameter to change the path
  of the action URI; if empty, returns the current action URI as-is (the
  default).


Solar_View_Helper_Form
----------------------

* [ADD] Method _addCsrfElement() to add any existing CSRF token element to the
  form, if no such element already exists.

* [CHG] Method fetch() calls _addCsrfElement() first thing.
