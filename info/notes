New Classes
-----------

* Solar_View_Helper_FormCsrf: Individual CSRF form element helper.


Solar_Struct
------------

* [FIX] In method toString(), use toArray() to get the internal data instead
  of the data property; this allows for child overrides. Thanks, probd, for
  the report leading to this fix.


Solar_Sql_Model_Related
-----------------------

* [FIX] When eager conditions are present, and no join type is specified, use
  an 'inner' join by default. This is to mimic the behavior of WHERE
  conditions. Thanks, Jeff Surgeson, for the report leading to this fix.


Solar_View_Helper_Form
----------------------

* [ADD] Property $_attribs_form to retain the merged form-tag attributes from 
  the view level and the auto level.

* [REF] Extract new method _setAttribsForm() from _buildBegin() to merge the
  form-tag attributes from the various levels.

* [CHG] Method fetch() now calls _setAttribsForm() to merge the form-tag
  attributes, instead of having that happen internally to _buildBegin().

* [CHG] Method _addCsrfElement(), when no CSRF element already exists, will no
  longer add a CSRF element on its own when using 'method="get"'. (This
  partially addresses a concern from Jon Elofson about sending CSRF tokens
  in GET requests; thanks, Jon, for the report.)


Solar_View_Helper_NamedAction
-----------------------------

* [CHG] Use a URI object, not an href string, for generating the action URI.


Solar_View_Helper_NamedActionHref
---------------------------------

* [CHG] Use a URI object for generating the href, instead of accessing the
  rewrite rules directly.


Solar_View_Helper_NamedActionUri
--------------------------------

* [CHG] This is now the source for named actions, instead of namedActionHref.
  This is to help make action*() helpers and namedAction*() methods more
  consistent with each other.
