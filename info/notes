      Rodrigo Moraes.  Thanks Rodrigo, and thanks Clay for updating the
      Xcache adapter.
      
    * [NEW] Solar_Json: ext/json compatibility class, fully unit tested
      for to mirror JSON handling behavior of PECL's ext/json, which is
      enabled by default in PHP 5.2.0. Based on work from the 
      Services_JSON package by Michal Migurski, Matt Knapp, and Brett
      Stimmerman.  Thanks Clay.
      
    * [NEW] Solar_Json_Checker based on work by Douglas Crockford.

      Fortin.

* Solar

    * [FIX] Solar::fileExists() had a bug that prevented it from
      working correctly on Windows when it is encountered an absolute
      path beginning with "/" or an include_path directory ending in "/"
      because DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR on Windows is "\". Per note from Mike
      Naberezny.
    
    * [CHG] Solar::fileExists() now checks for Windows drive letter. Per
      email from Jeremy Cook.
    
    * [CHG] Solar::start() now starts a session regardless of PHP_SAPI
      value (i.e., whether 'cli' or not).
      
    * [NEW] Solar::dirname() method helps to find higher-level
      directories; e.g., you can call Solar::dirname(__FILE__, 2)
      instead of dirname(dirname(dirname(__FILE__))).
    
* Solar_Access_Adapter_File

    * [FIX] In fetch(), when $handle is empty, do not force to '*'.
    
* Solar_App_Bookmarks

    * [FIX] Views now use count($this->list) to determine if there are
      list items.
    
    * [FIX] Bookmarks app now properly creates 'areas' table (thanks
      Rodrigo Moraes and Jeff Surgeson)
      
* Solar/App/Layout

    * [NEW] File _head.php now uses meta, base, and title helpers
      (thanks for the reminder, Jeff Surgeson).
    
    * [CHG] Styles default.css now using new form-helper class tags
      (input-text, input-textarea, etc)
    
    * [NEW] File _head.php uses new js() helper to load additional
      scripts; thanks Clay.

* Solar/App/Public/images

    * [NEW] Added "indicators/" dir with in-progress indicator images;
      thanks Clay.
    
* Solar/App/Public/scripts

    * [NEW] Embedding prototype and scriptaculous in the standard
      distribution; thanks Clay.
    
* Solar_Auth

    * [FIX] When reading adapter-provided error code, use $code, not
      $err. Thanks, Rodrigo Moraes.

* Solar_Auth_Adapter_Typekey

    * [FIX] The optional Solar_Cache dependency object was not being
      loaded correctly.

* Solar_Content

    * [NEW] Added new 'sql' config key for Solar_Sql dependency
      injection (applies to the encapsulated Model objects).
      
* Solar_Content_Bookmarks

    * [CHG] The 'summ' form element is now a textarea, and added
      'reqire' flags to 'uri' and 'tags' elements.
    
* Solar_Controller_Front

    * [CHG] When asking for 'page_name', 'page-name', or 'pageName', now
      converts that to 'PageName'.

* Solar_Controller_Page

    * [CHG] Removed _getLayout() method, replaced with
      _setViewLayout($view). The new method re-uses the existing
      page-level View object and resets the template stack to look at
      Layout templates (vice Page templates). This auto-shares helper
      objects and assigned vars from the page-level view to the
      layout-level. Incidentally, this takes less code and runs faster.
      Per discussion with Clay Loveless.
    
    * [CHG] Non-Solar vendor views and layouts now have a final fallback
      to the generic Solar views and layouts.
    
    * [CHG] Method _setViewLayout() no longer type-hints to Solar_View.
    
    * [FIX] Previously, $this->_name returned a value with a leading
      underscore, now it does not.
    
* Solar_Flash

    * [NEW] Added method reset() to clear all values.
    
* Solar_Form

    * [NEW] Added a new key to the element hints, 'status', to track 
      the validation status of individual elements.  (This is a ternary:
      true if validation succeeded, false if validation failed, null if
      validation has not been attempted.)
      
* Solar_Role_Adapter_File

    * [FIX] In method fetch(), strpos() params were reversed.
    
* Solar_Sql_Rowset

    * [CHG] When asking for a non-existent key from offsetGet(), returns
      null.
  
* Solar_Sql_Table

    * [CHG] Method update() now forces the update time (thanks Jeff
      Surgeson).

* Solar_Test_Suite

    * [CHG] Now skips files that don't end in ".php", also skips dirs
      that do not start with a capital letter.  This is to support
      bundling of support files for tests (e.g. the Markdown torture-
      test suite).
    
* Solar_View

    * [FIX] Methods getHelper() and newHelper() now force first char of
      helper name to lower case; this is to erase internal confusion
      between "helperName" and "HelperName" when calling helpers as
      methods.
    
    * [BRK] BC BREAK: The partial() method now **returns** the results
      of the template script, rather than echoing them directly. You
      should change all uses of `$this->partial(...)` to `echo
      $this->partial(...)`.
      
* Solar_View_Helper_Action

    * [CHG] Added 3rd param $attribs for href attribs, per note from
      Rodrigo Moraes.
      
* Solar_View_Helper_Form

    * [CHG] Combined all CSS classes for status, feedback, etc. into one
      property.
    
    * [CHG] No more "*" in front of required elements; instead, adds
      'class="require"' to the element itself, as well as the <dt> and
      <dd> tags related to it.
    
    * [CHG] Element-specific classes are now assigned at addElement()
      time, not fetch() time.
