* General

    * Per note from Rodrigo Moraes, Solar_Sql selections of 'all' or
      'row' now let you select the class of the return object. Defaults
      are Solar_Sql_Rowset for 'all' and Solar_Sql_Row for 'row'.
      Affects Solar_Sql, Solar_Sql_Rowset, Solar_Sql_Select, and
      Solar_Sql_Table.

* New classes:

    * Solar_View_Helper_Meta, Solar_View_Helper_MetaName, and
      Solar_View_Helper_MetaHttp for <meta ... /> tag construction,
      based on work by Jeff Surgeson and Rodrigo Moraes.
      
* Solar_Content_Abstract

    * Method delete() now deletes node parts, and disallows deletion
      where $id is empty or zero
    
* Solar_Controller_Page

    * Added _isSubmit() method to check submission values. Previously,
      you would check if (Solar::post('submit') ==
      $this->locale('SUBMIT_SAVE')). Now you use check if
      ($this->_isSubmit('save')).

* Solar_Struct

    * Per email with Antti Holvikari, keys are now settable instead of
      being set-once.
    
    * Method load() now lets you reset the data entirely using a second
      $reset parameter (set to boolean true) instead of merging with
      existing keys (the default behavior)

* Solar_Sql

    * Method select('all') and select('row') now support setting the
      class of the returned object using a 4th param, $class.

* Solar_Sql_Rowset

    * New property $_row_class sets the class of individual row objects.
    
* Solar_Sql_Select

    * Method fetch() has a 2nd param, $class, to set the class of 'all'
      and 'row' return objects

* Solar_Sql_Table

    * Two new properties, $_all_class and $_row_class, to define what
      fetchAll() and fetch/fetchNew/fetchWhere() should use as the
      return class type
