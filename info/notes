* General

    * Solar.config.php

        * [FIX] now uses 'name' key for sqlite adapter; thanks, Micahel Caplan
    
        * [CHG] updated example config file per note from Travis

* Solar

    * [ADD] Added loadInterface() method per notes from Antti, Rodrigo, and
      Clay. Thanks guys.

    * [ADD] Method Solar::temp() to get the system temporary directory, with
      an optional sub-path added to it.

* Solar_Auth

    * [ADD] Added $uid property and session store key in support of numeric
      user IDs reported by adapters.

* Solar_Auth_Adapter

    * [ADD] Added $_uid property and getUid() method to support numeric user
      ID values (as opposed to string handles).

* Solar_Auth_Adapter_Ini

    * [ADD] Added support for 'email', 'moniker', 'uri', and 'uid' values.

* Solar_Auth_Adapter_Sql

    * [ADD] Added support for 'uid' values.

* Solar_Auth_Adapter_Typekey

    * [ADD] Added pseudo-support for 'uid' values. (TypeKey doesn't actually
      return such a value, but it's needed for consistency with other
      adapters.)

* Solar_Cache_Adapter_File
    
    * [CHG] Updated to use new Solar::temp() functionality.

* Solar_Content_Abstract

    * [FIX] In fetchTags() method, deconflicted 'name' to 'tags.name' in GROUP
      and ORDER clauses. Thanks for the patch, Travis Swicegood.

* Solar_Controller_Page

    * [ADD] New $_helper_class property lets you add helper classes between
      the "Solar" final fallback and the vendor- and app-specific helpers.
    
    * [CHG] The _render() method now gives better exception information when a
      template is not found, and uses ERR_TEMPLATE_NOT_FOUND instead of
      ERR_VIEW_NOT_FOUND (to distinguish from PartialNotFound).
    
    * [CHG] The _getView() method no longer adds Solar_View_Helper to the
      class stack; Solar_View automatically sets that as the final fallback
      regardless.

* Solar_Docs_Apiref

    * [CHG] Now uses the $_ignore property again to ignore certain
      undocumented internal (PHP) classes, especially the Exception class.
    
    * [CHG] No more tracking of internal classes.
    
    * [CHG] Removed "fake" doc array for internal Exception class.
    
* Solar_Exception

    * [ADD] Method getInfo() now takes an optional key, to get the value of
      just one info key (default is still to get the entire array).
    
* Solar_Model_Nodes

    * [BRK] The "unique_in_area" multiple index has changed; please update the
      "nodes" table manually.

      Previously, it was a unique index on "area_id" and "name". This causes
      problems when you have two different node types with the same name. As a
      result, the name has changed to "area_type_name" and is a unique index
      on "area_id", "type", and "name".
      
      To update existing tables, issue two SQL commands similar to these:
      
      DROP INDEX nodes__unique_in_area__i ON nodes;
      CREATE UNIQUE INDEX nodes__area_type_name__i ON nodes (area_id, type, name);

* Solar_Sql_Adapter_*

    * [CHG] The nextSequence() method now explicitly calls _connect() before
      attempting to increment. Thanks, Michael Caplan.
    
    * [CHG] The quote() method no longer quotes numeric values, to soothe
      SQLite and others.

* Solar_Sql_Select

    * [CHG] Methods leftJoin() and innerJoin() no longer require that you
      select columns (thanks Antti).

* Solar_View

    * [CHG] Modified partial() method to return a PartialNotFound exception
      when the requested partial is not found; this makes error-checking more
      accurate.

* Solar_View_Helper_Form

    * [CHG] Form tag is now optional at fetch() time, per note from Rodrigo
      Moraes.
    
    * [CHG] When an element is not found, now adds the element info to the
      exception.
    
* Solar_Role_Adapter_File

    * [FIX] When checking file lines, now removes all whitespace characters
      before splitting at ":" and ",". Per bug noted by Clay where last
      user-handle on the line was not recognized, because of the trailing
      newline character.
