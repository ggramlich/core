Overall
-------

* Added localized exception messages for all known ERR_* codes, standardized
  which exception codes are used, added more info to some exceptions for
  their messages, and added several exception classes.

* Added help text for all CLI commands.


Solar
-----

* [CHG] In method start(), guard base-class loading with class_exists().
  Thanks, Jeff Moore, for the report; and thanks, Stloyd, for the patch.

* [FIX] In method exception(), when the vendor class is not Solar, add Solar
  as the final fallback.


Solar_Access_Adapter_Sql
------------------------

* [FIX] Prefix column names with the table name in WHERE and ORDER BY sections
  of the SELECT query; using column names such as "order" no longer results in
  an error. Thanks, dmytrok.


Solar_Auth_Adapter_Sql
----------------------

* [FIX] Prefix column names with the table name in WHERE sections of the
  SELECT query; using column names such as "order" no longer results in an
  error. Thanks, dmytrok.


Solar_App_Hello
---------------

* [FIX] Turn off layout for the index action.


Solar_Cache_Adapter*
--------------------

* [CHG] In methods save(), add(), fetchOrSave(), fetchOrAdd(), and
  _fetchOrInsert(), add a new trailing parameter $life to override the default
  lifespan for the cache entry.


Solar_Cache_Adapter_File
------------------------

* [BRK] Now uses a .meta file to store expire and serial values, instead of
  using filemtime() for expiry and a .serial file for the serialization flag.
  This is to enable per-entry expiration. You may need to clear your file
  caches for this to operate properly after you upgrade.


Solar_Cli_Help
--------------

* [FIX] No longer print double newlines between help text and options.


Solar_Cli_MakeApp
-----------------

* [BRK] No longer takes a --target option; writes always and only to the
  Solar system "include" directory.


Solar_Cli_MakeCli
-----------------

* [BRK] No longer takes a --target option; writes always and only to the
  Solar system "include" directory.


Solar_Cli_MakeModel
-------------------

* [BRK] No longer takes a --target option; writes always and only to the
  Solar system "include" directory.


Solar_Cli_MakeTests
-------------------

* [BRK] No longer takes a --target option; writes always and only to the
  Solar system "include" directory.


Solar_Cli_MakeVendor
--------------------

* [FIX] In config/default.php, *do not* create a $config variable, because it
  overwrites the main $config value. Thanks, probd, for the report and patch.

* [FIX] Renamed options.txt to options.php in order for options to work as
  expected. Thanks, dmytrok.

* [FIX] Removed surplus and misleading "<?php\n" from the top of help.txt
  file. Thanks, dmytrok.


Solar_Cli_RunTests
------------------

* [BRK] No longer takes a --dir option; always and only runs tests from the
  Solar system "include" directory.


Solar_Form
----------

* [CHG] Remove empty default attributes 'class', 'id', and 'name' (these are
  not elsewhere present or used in Solar_Form, nor in Solar_View_Helper_Form).

* [DEL] Property $_filters is never used; removed.

* [BRK] In method getElements(), when you provide a string prefix, it now
  returns all elements with that string prefix, not just sub-elements of that
  array name.


Solar_Locale
------------

* [ADD] Method getLanguageCode() to get an RFC 1766 compliant language-code
  string.


Solar_Role_Adapter_Sql
----------------------

* [FIX] Prefix column names with the table name in WHERE sections of the
  SELECT query; using column names such as "order" no longer results in an
  error. Thanks, dmytrok.


Solar_Uri
---------

* [CHG] In method set(), also check to see if the server port is 443, to see
  if we should use an https scheme. Thanks, Robert Gonzalez, for this fix.


Solar_View_Helper_Form
----------------------

* [CHG] Add config key 'decorator_attribs' and property $_decorator_attribs to
  retain custom attributes for decorator tags.

* [BRK] Config key 'decorators' and property $_decorators are now renamed to
  'decorator_tags' and $_decorator_tags, respectively.

* [CHG] Method _buildElementBegin() now takes a second paramter for the
  element information, so it can add the right class names to the element
  decorator.

* [CHG] Method _buildDecoratorBegin() honors the new custom decorator
  attributes.

* [CHG] Method _buildDecoratorBegin() now adds the decorator type as a class
  only when the class attribute is empty, instead of always adding it.

* [ADD] Method decorateAsDivs() to decorate the list and the element (but not
  the label or value) with a <div> tag.

* [CHG] Method setDecorator() now takes a third param, $attribs, as attributes
  for the decorator type.

* [CHG] Method setDecorators() now honors two kinds of specifications.  The
  old style, where the $list value is a string tag name, is honored.  The
  newly added style is where the $list value is an array, where the first
  element is a string tag name, and the second element is an array of
  key-value pairs ('attrib' => 'value').

* [ADD] Methods setDecoratorAttribs() and addDecoratorAttribs() to set
  decorator attributes directly.

* [CHG] Rename property $_attribs to $_attribs_view, to indicate attributes
  for the form tag that are set directly at the view-helper level.

* [ADD] Properte $_attribs_auto, to retain attributes for the form tag that 
  are set indirectly via the auto() method.

* [CHG] Method auto() now retains attributes from the spec in $_attribs_auto,
  not in $_attribs_view.

* [CHG] Method reset() no longer merges $_default_attribs and 
  $this->_config['attribs'] into $_attribs_view; merging of defaults now 
  occurs at fetch-time.  It does, however, reset $_attribs_view and
  $_attribs_auto.

* [CHG] Method _buildBegin() now merges form-tag attributes internally
  when building the form tag.  The order of precedence from lowest to
  highest is: $_default_attribs, $_config['attribs'], $_attribs_auto,
  $attribs_view.  This is so that attribs set directly in the view always
  take precedence over attribs set indirectly via the auto() method.

* [BRK] Previously, checkbox labels (when not in groups) were put in the
  'label' portion of the element, and the checkbox value itself was *not*
  wrapped in a label. This left the checkbox itself sitting alone, and
  clicking on the somewhat distant label for it would check/uncheck the box.
  This has proved unintuitive, troublesome, and unpopular. As such, checkboxes
  will now be wrapped with their label in the value portion of the element,
  and the label portion of the element will be left blank. Sorry for the
  trouble, folks.

* [ADD] In method beginFieldset(), add a second parameter $attribs, used to
  provide attributes for the fieldset tag. This changes the internal $_stack
  descriptor for fieldsets, which is now honored by _buildFieldset*() methods.

* [CHG] Slightly better error messages for magic __call().

* [REF] Extract method meta() from auto(), to handle setting of meta-info
  about the form view (attribs, feedback, and status) using a form object.


Solar_View_Helper_FormCheckbox
------------------------------

* [ADD] Add config key 'label_class' to add a CSS class to the label tag
  wrapping the checkbox input; this will help target labels on checkboxes (vs
  generic input labels).

* [FIX] Use getText() for the label text so that locale keys get translated
  properly (vice escape()).


Solar_View_Helper_FormRadio
---------------------------

* [FIX] Radio buttons IDs are now suffixed with an incremental count.

* [ADD] Config key 'label_class' to specify a CSS class for the label tag wrapping the radio input.

* [FIX] Use getText() for the label text so that locale keys get translated
  properly (vice escape()).


Solar_View_Helper_Form(Timestamp|Date|Time)
-------------------------------------------

* [ADD] Config keys 'y_first' and 'y_last', to set defaults for the first and
  last years shown as select options. (These can be either low-to-high or 
  high-to-low.)

* [ADD] Method _prepare() to override the parent; this allows us to retain
  element info keys for 'y_first' and 'y_last' which determine the first and
  last years shown as select options.
  
* [ADD] Properties $_y_first and $_y_last for the first and last years shown.

* [CHG] Method _selectYear() now honors the $_y_first and $_y_last properties,
  instead of showing only +/- 4 years from the current year.

* [CHG] Method _selectHour() now shows 00-24 instead of 00-23.

* [CHG] The '-' empty-value has been removed from all select options.

* [CHG] Method _prepare(), when no value is present, now defaults the value
  to the current timestamp using `date('Y-m-d H:i:s')`.
