Solar_Sql_Adapter and Solar_Sql_Adapter_Mysql
---------------------------------------------

* [FIX] The previous fix on ticket #243 breaks Postgres. This fix adds a
  method, Solar_Sql_Adapter::_selectSingleFrom(), to make building the FROM
  clause overridable behavior; the default behavior is *not* to use
  parentheses. The added Solar_Sql_Adapter_Mysql::_selectSingleFrom() method
  overrides the base adapter to add parentheses per the original fix on #234.
  Thanks, Anthony Gentile, for the report that led to this fix.


Solar_Cli_MakeDocbook
---------------------

* [FIX] Change .xml skeletons to .txt. This is because the PEAR packaging
  system silently ignores package.xml files, so we have to name the data file
  .txt instead. Method _loadTemplates() honors the new extension properly.
