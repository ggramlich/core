* General
    
    * [NEW] Solar_Request class acts as an interface to the $_GET,
      $_POST, etc. superglobals. This is effectively a singleton class,
      as it hooks in directly to the superglobals, which are themselves
      shared across the whole PHP execution environment. (In a future
      version, this will become a non-static class suitable for
      dependency injection.)
    
    * [NEW] Solar_Session class acts as an interface to the $_SESSION
      superglobal, and automatically segmetns $_SESSION keys by class
      name so that different classes don't overwrite other classes'
      keys. Includes read-once "flash" methods, so this class supersedes
      Solar_Flash.
    
    * [NEW] Solar_View_Helper_TypekeyLink generates a link to the TypeKey
      authentication site.
    
    * [DEL] Solar_Flash class; superseded by Solar_Session.
    
    * [CHG] In test.php test runnner, added small niceties for running
      tests in a browser. Thanks Clay.
    
* Solar

    * [BRK] All methods related to request environment removed, are
      replaced by equivalents in Solar_Request and Solar_Session: get(),
      post(), cookie(), server(), session(), files(), pathinfo(), and
      related support methods.
    
    * [CHG] Dispelling of magic quotes has been moved to Solar_Request,
      and operates only on Solar_Request values (not the original $_GET
      et. al. values) ... although Solar still removes
      register_globals() variables from the global scope.
      
    * [CHG] Moved code in two protected methods called only in one place
      each to the calling location: _globalsQuotes() code to start(),
      and _loadLocale() to locale().

    * [CHG] Solar no longer starts a session automatically. Sorry to
      keep going back and forth on this; introduction of the new
      Solar_Session should be the final interation here.
    
    * [FIX] Now uses DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR to define the default config
      file location (this helps Windows users, per note from Clay
      Loveless).
      
* Solar_App and all related

    * [CHG] All applications now use Solar_Request and Solar_Session
      instead of Solar::get(), etc. and Solar_Flash.

* Solar_App_Bookmarks

    * [CHG] In edit view, now uses Scriptaculous effects on
      success/failure instead of simple styling.
    
    * [CHG] Edit action now regognizes "add_ok" flash key, and shows
      proper feedback message in the related view. Per notes from Jeff
      Surgeson.
      
* Solar/App/Public/scripts

    * [CHG] Updated to Prototype 1.5.0_rc1 and Scriptaculous 1.6.4
    
    * [ADD] Added minimized script versions in scripts-min/*.  To use
      these, modify the `path` key in your JS helper configs.

* Solar/App/Public/styles

    * [DEL] Removed success/failure style from default stylesheet in
      favor of Scriptaculous highlight effects. (See
      Solar/App/Bookmarks/View/edit.php for examples.)
      
* Solar_Auth

    * [CHG] Uses new Solar_Session and Solar_Request classes instead of
      Solar::get(), etc. and Solar_Flash.
    
* Solar_Content_Abstract

    * [FIX] Fixes for part-counts in content domain model. Previously,
      if a node type has more than one kind of part, when you got a
      count of parts, each part-type had the count of *all* part types
      (not just its own). This was related to grouping of nodes based on
      the node ID. So now we need to separately fetch the count of parts
      for a node, and manually add those counts to each row. While not
      great, it's a far cry better than using sub-selects to fetch
      part-counts as part of a single query (which results in a
      full-table scan at the database and thus will not scale at all).

* Solar_Controller_Page

    * [CHG] Now uses Solar_Request and Solar_Session instead of
      Solar::get(), etc. and Solar_Flash.

    * [FIX] Solar_Controller_Page::_render() is now protected.

    * [NEW] Added Solar_Controller_Page_Exception, along with extended
      exceptions for PropertyNotDefined and ActionNotFound.
    
    * [CHG] Method _isSubmit() now allows an empty $type param, which
      will tells you if *any* submit-type was posted.
      
* Solar_Docs_Apiref

    * [BRK] Removed $_ignore property in preparation for a better
      solution to documenting classes based on internal PHP classes
      (esp. Exception).  As a result, you'll see a lot more errors logged
      on classes descended from internal PHP classes (esp. Exception).

    * [CHG] Added _loadInternal() method to load fake API doc arrays for
      internal PHP classes (e.g. Exception).

* Solar_Form

    * [CHG] Now uses Solar_Request instead of Solar::get(), etc.
    
* Solar_Log

    * [BRK] Now uses the Solar standard for passing configs to adapters.
      That is, instead all keys being passed to the adapter, now passes
      only the `config` key to the adapter.

* Solar_Markdown

    * [CHG] Standard Markdown plugins for spans of type AmpsAngles,
      EmStrong, and Break now insert HTML tokens for their tags instead
      of HTML text; this is to help with more aggressive escaping when
      needed by other plugins.

* Solar_Markdown_Wiki

    * [FIX] Security fixes to Solar_Markdown plugins to remove
      span-level XSS vulnerabilities in Solar_Markdown_Wiki.

    * [ADD] Solar_Markdown_Wiki_Escape, a span-level plugin to escape
      HTML.

    * [DEL] Removed Markdown Wiki plugins for EmStrong, Paragraph, and
      Table; the extra escaping provided by these block-level wiki
      plugins is now handled by the new Wiki Escape span-level plugin.

    * [CHG] Added support for ATX-style ("# Title") headers in
      Solar_Markdown_Wiki_Header
    
    * [CHG] Solar_Markdown_Wiki now uses a modified plugin set, based on
      changes in standard plugins, removed Wiki plugins, and new Wiki
      Escape plugin.

* Solar_Model_Nodes

    * [BRK] No longer provides default editor_ipaddr value, as usage of
      Solar::server() has been removed entirely.
      
* Solar_Role

    * [CHG] Converted from $_SESSION to Solar_Session.
    
* Solar_Struct

    * [FIX] When constructing with an empty array or no data, now
      returns an empty array instead of an array with one empty element.
      Thanks, Jeremy Cook.

* Solar_Sql

    * [CHG] Method select('assoc') no longer removes the first column
      from the result set.

* Solar_Test_Suite

    * [FIX] No longer forces 'text' output in the default log object;
      this helps with browser-based testing.
      
* Solar_Uri

    * [CHG] Now uses Solar_Request instead of Solar::get(), etc.
    
    * [CHG] Added better checking when URI values are forced (i.e., when
      partial URIs are processed).
    
* Solar_View_Helper_Form

    * [CHG] Now uses Solar_Request instead of Solar::get(), etc.
    
    * [FIX] When outputting a checkbox that is not in a group, it does
      not get its own label. This prevents double-labelling of checkbox.
      Per note from Rodrigo Moraes.
    
* Solar_View_Helper_Js

    * [NEW] Added method addInlineScript(). Unlike regular inlineScript
      helper, this method allows snippets of JavaScript to be added to
      the stack that will be dumped into one single inlineScript call in
      the document header.
    
    * [NEW] Now allows scripts to register the need for particular
      stylesheets with the addStyle() method.

* Solar_View_Helper_JsLibrary

    * [NEW] Now allows scripts to retreive script-specific stylesheets
      with the _fetchStyles() method.
      
* Solar_View_Helper_JsScriptaculous

    * [FIX] Added useNamedSelector flag. Fixes issue where effect calls
      made with true would return a JS string without a named selector,
      but with a reference of the type used in the observe loop instead.

    * [CHG] Now uses more elegant 'invoke' approach for named selectors.

* Solar_View_Helper_PublicHref

    * [CHG] To support literal HREF values, now checks for "://" in the
      $spec param. Per notes from Rodrigo Moraes and Clay Loveless.
    
* Solar_View_Helper_Script

    * [NEW] Added new `anti_cache` config key. When set to true, appends
      a query string to the HREF, thus forcing the script to re-load 
      from the server in place of the client-side cached version.
      
* Solar_View_Helper_Style

    * [CHG] Removed literal HREF checking now that it's in the PublicHref
      helper.  Per notes from Rodrigo Moraes and Clay Loveless.
