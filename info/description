Solar is a class library and application component suite for PHP 5 (and
is PHP5 E_STRICT compliant). Solar provides simple, easy-to-comprehend
classes and components for the common aspects of web-based rapid
application development.

Solar is designed for developers who intend to distribute their
applications to the whole world.  This means, for example, the database
driver functions work exactly the same way for each supported database. 
It also means that localization support is built in from the start.
