Solar is a framework for PHP 5 that provides structured, easy-to-comprehend
E_STRICT class libraries for the common aspects of application development.

Solar is for developers who intend to distribute their applications to the
whole world. This means, for example, the database driver functions work
exactly the same way for each supported database. It also means that
localization support is built in from the start.
