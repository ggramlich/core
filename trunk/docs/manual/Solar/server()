This method accesses the $_SERVER superglobal array and
returns a copy of the requested key.  If no key is
specified, a copy of the entire $_SERVER array is
returned.  If the requested key does not exist in the $_SERVER
array, the default value is returned instead.

For example, to get the 'REQUEST_URI' key from the $_SERVER
array, with `false` as the default value, you would do this:

{{code: php
    $remember_me = Solar::server('REQUEST_URI', false);
}}
