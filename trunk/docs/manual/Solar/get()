This method accesses the $_GET superglobal array and returns a
copy of the requested key.  If no key is specified,
a copy of the entire $_GET array is returned.  If the
requested key does not exist in the $_GET array, the default
value is returned instead.

For example, to get the 'user_name' key from the $_GET array,
with 'No Name' as the default value, you would do this:

{{code: php
    $name = Solar::get('user_name', 'No Name');
}}
