This arch-class stands over and above all
other Solar classes in that it provides functionality needed
throughout the entire environment.

Unlike most other classes in Solar, the `Solar` class is
composed entirely of static methods and objects.  This means you
never need to instantiate a `Solar` object proper; just include
it.

{{code: php
    // after you load the Solar class,
    require_once 'Solar.php';

    // **do not** instantiate it.
    $solar = new Solar();
    $solar->start();

    // just call its static methods.
    Solar::start();
    $action = Solar::get('action');
    $result = Solar::run('/path/to/file.php');
    Solar::stop();
}}

Once you have loaded the Solar.php file, you can call any of the ClassMethods it provides.
