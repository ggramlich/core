Style Guide
====================

--------------------
Coding Style
--------------------

Solar classes adhere to the [PEAR coding standards](http://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.php), with one minor deviation.  In PEAR, only private elements have an underscore prefix; in Solar, both private and protected elements have an underscore prefix.

--------------------
Problem-Solving Style
--------------------

When writing a class for Solar, the author should strive for simple, easy-to-test, and easy-to-explain solutions.  We all want fast execution, but authors should err on the side of slower-but-simpler instead of faster-but-obtuse.

Obtuse or complex code, if thoroughly commented and outlined with inline narrative comments as a teaching exercise, is permissible.  Remember, some poor guy is going to have to figure this out; take a little extra time and comment your genius so that others can comprehend it.

--------------------
Documentation
--------------------

Use [phpDocumentor](http://phpdoc.org) documentation blocks for every property and method.  This makes it easy to auto-generate API documentation.

More difficult and time-consuming, but far more important, is to write end-user narrative or how-to pages for every class.  This tells use the user what to do with the class, and how, and why.
